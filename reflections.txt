You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:

  * What new skills have you learned?
  I've learned how to take a markup and turn it into HTML. There are a lot of things contained inside of that but that is the basic idea. 

  * What has been easy?
  The idea of HTML is fairly simiple. It's very visual and you get instant feedback. So it makes it simple to understand what your commands are doing. 

  * What has been difficult?
  There hasn't been too much that's been difficult so far. Execpt for the fact that sometimes you just need a break, even if the material is simple. 

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  I've made sure to take take a break when my eyes start to hurt from looking at the computer for so long.
